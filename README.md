# The Story Behind Covid Busters

I made Covid Busters, a site for registering for vaccination, during the fall of 2020 for my second web development class.

We were in the thick of the pandemic, and this site was about the promise of something that could potentially make the world go back to normal and stop the suffering of so many people around the globe.

This was a great idea, and I tried to give it justice.

I was limited by my knowledge of PHP because this was the first time I even saw PHP code, but all in all, the website turned out great.

It was functional, you could register for vaccination on it, and thanks to the HTML and CSS I reused and modified from my previous project called [Set With Friends](https://github.com/ZoltanKuli/SET-With-Friends), it looked nice.

Also, learning PHP was a breath of fresh air since, as I have mentioned, it was entirely new for me, and it was fun learning something different than what I was used to.
